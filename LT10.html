                        iMac takes a leap in performance and AI capability with the M4 chip. A faster CPU makes
                        everything
                        you do even snappier. An advanced GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing delivers
                        unbelievably
                        realistic graphics. The enhanced Media Engine lets you edit multiple streams of 4K video
                        smoothly.
                        Up to 32GB of faster unified memory enables frictionless gameplay and seamless multitasking
                        across
                        apps. And our powerful Neural Engine makes on-device Apple Intelligence soar.</td>
