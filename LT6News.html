                The top priority at this year's summit is expected to be landing a deal to boost funding for climate action in developing countries.

                Some are pushing for the current pledge of $100 billion (€93 billion) a year to be raised by 10 times that amount at COP29 to cover the future cost of shifting to clean energy and adapting to climate shocks.

                His Premier League team, Brighton, had even gone to the trouble of commissioning a scale-model replica of the World Cup trophy for him to lift.

                Few of Mac Allister’s teammates on the Argentina squad that became world champions three months ago experienced such a lavish welcome when they returned to their clubs, but most were treated to some sort of celebration, a heartfelt recognition of their achievement.es to their climate goals, which countries are required to submit by early next year....

                <p>While Apple typically doesn’t disclose sales numbers and is usually very coy when commenting on sales performance in specific countries or regions, Cook sounded particularly confident when discussing how the iPhone 17 family was doing in China, following a rather extended period of slumping sales in the cou.... <a href="">read more</a></p>
